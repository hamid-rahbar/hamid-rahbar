## Hello World! 🌎

As a **data analyst**, I am skilled in both **analyzing data** and **storytelling**. I am able to extract insights and patterns from complex datasets using a variety of tools and methodologies, and am able to present the findings in a clear and compelling way, using data visualization and narrative storytelling to convey the key takeaways. 

Whether I am working on a project to optimize business operations, identify trends and opportunities, or support decision-making, I am able to leverage my skills in data analysis and storytelling to **drive results** and **create values**.

Some languages/technologies I enjoy working with are **Excel, SQL, and of course Python!** :)  

On my GitHub profile, you can find some of the projects I have worked on, including **S&P 500 Stock Analysis**, **US Real Estate Analysis**, and **COVID-19 Pandemic Analysis**. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, and welcome the chance to collaborate with others in the data community.
