I am a **data analyst** who have a strong passion for **helping businesses** identify their problems and find solutions. I believe that understanding the root cause of a problem is crucial for finding an effective solution, and I enjoy the challenge of digging deep to get to the heart of the issue.


Whether through data analysis or by working with stakeholders, I am dedicated to finding ways to improve business processes and **drive positive change**. I am constantly seeking opportunities to use my skills and knowledge **to make a difference** for businesses, and I am always eager to learn more about how I can help organizations solve their challenges.

Some languages/technologies I enjoy working with are **Excel, SQL, and of course Python!** :)
